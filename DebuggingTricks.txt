3. Using variables outside their scope

4. 100 lines of coding. 5 to 10 lines. comment that particular line
5. Print the values of variable in the console
    function onMousePressed(object){
        console.log("hi ! i am clicked")
    }
    restart(){
        gameState = PLAY;
        //helps me to restart the program
